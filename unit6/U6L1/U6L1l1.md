There are a large amount of issues in my school and general community all around me. These range from social issues to physical issues, and even to conceptual issues. For instance, for some families and individuals in my community, stable income, housing and food may be a significant issue. There may also be issues such as making friends, and dealing with potential drama that may arise between friend groups. While those issues exist, there are also issues that affect my community which can be analyzed in the context of loops and data. Some of these issues include online issues such as commonly used passwords and account security, while other issues can be based in the real world such as the amount of food donated to families in need, for instance.
