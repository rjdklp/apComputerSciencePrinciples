I wish I had access to datasets that reflected more human behaviors and phenomena in the real world. For instance, I believe a dataset that describes the most common structures struck by lightning would be interesting to work with. To add, yearly lightning strikes and/or thunderstorms per country in the world would be an amazing dataset to filter through.
